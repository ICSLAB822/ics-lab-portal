ICS LAB is growing! We are excited to welcome three talented new PhD students to our research family this Fall semester.

**Alice Chen** joins us from Tsinghua University. Her research will focus on the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and security, specifically investigating adversarial attacks on generative AI models.

**David Lee** received his Master's degree from SJTU. He will be working on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and cloud security, aiming to build verifiable computing platforms for sensitive data processing.

**Michael Brown** comes with 2 years of industry experience in penetration testing. His research will explore IoT security and firmware analysis.

Please join us in giving them a warm welcome! We look forward to the innovative ideas and energy they will bring to the lab.
