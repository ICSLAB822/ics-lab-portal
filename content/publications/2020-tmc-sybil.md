Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable users to share their locations and find friends nearby. However, sharing location information raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we investigate the Sybil attacks in LBSNs where an adversary can create multiple fake identities to compromise user privacy. We propose a Sybil-resistant geo-privacy protection scheme that utilizes social trust and mobility patterns to detect and mitigate Sybil nodes effectively.
