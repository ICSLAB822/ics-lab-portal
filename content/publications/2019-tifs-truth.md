Mobile crowdsensing has emerged as a promising paradigm for collecting sensing data. However, the reliability of data and the privacy of participants are two critical issues. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving and Sybil-resistant truth discovery framework. We design a novel cryptographic protocol to protect participants' sensory data and reliability scores while allowing the aggregation server to discover truths. Security analysis demonstrates that our scheme is secure against various attacks.
