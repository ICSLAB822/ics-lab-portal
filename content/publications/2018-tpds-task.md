Spatial crowdsourcing platforms assign location-based tasks to workers. However, the location privacy of both workers and tasks is a major concern when the platform server is untrusted. We present a privacy-preserving task assignment scheme that matches tasks to workers based on their locations without revealing exact coordinates. Our approach leverages geo-indistinguishability and secure multi-party computation to ensure strong privacy guarantees.
