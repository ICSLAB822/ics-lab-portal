Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, model updates can still leak information. We introduce a differentially private FL algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between privacy budget and model accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
