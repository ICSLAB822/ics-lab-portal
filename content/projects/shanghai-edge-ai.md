Edge Intelligence (Edge AI) pushes model inference and training to the network edge, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. However, edge devices are often physically accessible and resource-constrained, making them vulnerable to attacks.

This project aims to build a comprehensive security framework for Edge AI, covering:
- **Model Security**: Protecting models from extraction and inversion attacks using watermarking and trusted execution environments (TEEs).
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Developing lightweight defense mechanisms against adversarial examples suitable for embedded devices.
- **Verifiable Computation**: Ensuring that the computation results returned by edge nodes are correct and haven't been tampered with.

We collaborate with local industry partners to pilot these technologies in smart manufacturing scenarios.
