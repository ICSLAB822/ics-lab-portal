summary: Research on robust privacy preservation techniques balancing data utility and user privacy in large-scale mobile sensing environments.

This project addresses the critical conflict between data utility and privacy preservation in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). As MCS applications proliferate in smart city scenarios, participants are reluctant to share sensory data due to privacy concerns.

Our research focuses on:
1. **Local Differential Privacy (LDP) Mechanisms**: Designing optimized perturbation algorithms that provide rigorous privacy guarantees on the user side before data leaves the device.
2. **Verifiable Truth Discovery**: Developing protocols that allow the server to aggregate data and estimate ground truth without accessing individual raw data, while ensuring workers cannot cheat.
3. **Incentive Mechanisms**: Creating privacy-aware incentive schemes that compensate users fairly for their privacy loss.

The project is expected to produce open-source libraries for privacy-preserving data collection and at least 5 high-impact journal publications.
