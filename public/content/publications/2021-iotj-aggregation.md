In Industrial IoT (IIoT), mobile crowdsensing can be used to monitor environmental conditions. We propose a privacy-preserving verifiable data aggregation scheme for IIoT. The scheme allows the industrial server to aggregate sensing data without accessing individual readings, while also enabling verification of data integrity to prevent injection attacks.
