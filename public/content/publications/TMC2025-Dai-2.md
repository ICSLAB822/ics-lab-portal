With the development of new generation communication technologies, the future maritime information networks pave the way to promote the exploration of ocean resources. Moreover, the underwater data center (UDC) is considered to be a significant data storage and computing unit in future maritime networks for providing ocean services. However, the current deployment of UDC faces the critical issues, i.e., the long-distance underwater transmission is unreliable and the energy consumption and resources of underwater transmission are overloaded. To address the two critical issues of unreliable data transmission and high resource overheads, in this paper, we present a hybrid semantic data transmission architecture in air-ocean integrated networks, which can perceive the sea surface data accurately and transmit it to the UDC for processing. Specifically, in surface layer, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) perceive ocean environment and send data to the buoy via non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) transmission to improve the channel utilization. In underwater layer, the buoy sends the collected data to UDC via semantic transmission, while the semantic fidelity metric is utilized to improve the transmission efficiency. A resource allocation problem for energy minimization is formulated to jointly optimize the semantic scaling factor, the NOMA decoding order, the communication and computing resource allocations. We exploit a decomposition approach to transform the problem into two sub-problems, where the optimal resource allocations are obtained by proposing efficient algorithms. Finally, we provide simulations to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that our proposal has the advantages of lower energy consumption compared to several baseline schemes.
