Efficient one-hop multicasting (OHM) of high-volume sensor data plays a pivotal role in the success of cooperative autonomous driving applications. Although millimeter-Wave (mmWave) bands demonstrate huge potential for high-bandwidth OHM data transmission, the challenge lies in enabling individual vehicles to locate and communicate with suitable neighbors in a fully distributed and highly dynamic scenario. This paper introduces mmV2V, a fully distributed OHM scheme designed for vehicular networks, comprising three tightly integrated protocols. Initially, synchronized vehicles perform a probabilistic neighbor discovery procedure, wherein randomly divided transmitters (or receivers) clockwise scan (or listen to) the surroundings in synchronization with heterogeneous Tx (or Rx) beams. This approach facilitates the identification of the vast majority of neighbors within a few repeated rounds. Subsequently, vehicles engage in negotiations with their neighbors to establish an optimal communication schedule in evenly distributed slots. Finally, matched pairs of neighboring vehicles commence high data rate transmissions using refined beams. We implement a prototype testbed to validate the feasibility of the main components of mmV2V. Extensive simulations based on generated and real-world traffic traces are conducted and the results demonstrate that mmV2V consistently achieves a high completion ratio in demanding OHM tasks across various traffic conditions.
