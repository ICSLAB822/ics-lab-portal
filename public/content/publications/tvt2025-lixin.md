The development of vehicular networks and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has driven the application of Metaverse in vehicular field. However, the limited resources of vehicular networks pose significant challenges to the real-time rendering of vehicular Metaverse, with the core bottleneck being high computational and transmission delays. In addition, the secrecy communication in vehicular networks is critical to Metaverse rendering. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware Metaverse rendering scheme in vehicular edge networks aimed at enhancing the users’ quality of experience (QoE). We design a collaborative rendering architecture, where the background elements and foreground objects are rendered in different layers by the Metaverse provider server (MPS), the roadside unit (RSU), and local terminals. Meanwhile, in the transmission link, we have taken secure communication into consideration. A joint optimization problem is constructed to minimize the total rendering delay of the system, synchronously optimizing the offloading strategy, confidentiality interruption strategy, and transmission latency strategy. To address the non-convexity of the problem, a hierarchical solution method is proposed, which converts it into convex subproblems to obtain the optimal solutions. Simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional schemes in terms of performance and computational efficiency.
