Acquiring the geographical distribution of neighbors can support more adaptive media access control (MAC) protocols and other safety applications in Vehicular ad hoc network (VANETs). However, it is very challenging for each vehicle to estimate its own neighbor distribution in a fully distributed setting. In this paper, we propose an online distributed neighbor distribution estimation scheme, called PeerProbe, in which vehicles collaborate with each other to probe their own neighborhood via simultaneous symbol-level wireless communication. An adaptive compressive sensing algorithm is developed to recover a neighbor distribution based on a small number of random probes with non-negligible noise. Moreover, the needed number of probes adapts to the sparseness of the distribution. We conduct extensive simulations and the results demonstrate that PeerProbe is lightweight and can accurately recover highly dynamic neighbor distributions in critical channel conditions.
