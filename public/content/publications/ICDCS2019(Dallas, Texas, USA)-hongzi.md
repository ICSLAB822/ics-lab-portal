Finding a small object (e.g., keys or a wallet) in an indoor environment (e.g., in a house or an office) can be frustrating. In this paper, we propose an innovative system, called HyperEar, to localize such an object using only one single smartphone, based on enhanced time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements over acoustic signals issued from the object. One major challenge is the hardware limitations of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) phone with a short separation between the two microphones and the low sampling rate of such microphones. HyperEar enhances the accuracy of TDoA measurements by virtually increasing distances between microphones through sliding the phone in the air. HyperEar requires no communication for synchronization between the phone and the object and is a low-cost and easy-to-use system. We evaluate the performance of HyperEar via extensive experiments in various indoor conditions and the results demonstrate that, for an object of 7m away, HyperEar can achieve a mean localization accuracy of about 15cm when the object in normal indoor environments.
