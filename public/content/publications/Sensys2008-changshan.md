To address the challenges of safety requirements in team-oriented activities such as mountain climbing and archaeological activities in complex terrains, we propose a novel scheme applying WSNs in safety assurance systems. Our design named SaSa employs a WSN which consists of sensors and PDAs carried by the archeologists. Basing on the sensory data, the status of every archeologist is actively monitored. SaSa can also estimate the locations of the archeologists by simply utilizing the network information from the WSN, without any additional equipment like GPS. SaSa supports safety evaluation through the analysis of the global topology information. In addition, it can notify the others for help when a team member falls in danger.
