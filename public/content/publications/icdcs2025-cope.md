Permission-requesting operations in smartphone applications are essential for security and privacy, but they often present significant challenges, including excessive permission requests, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient resource utilization. This paper introduces COPE, a novel framework designed to enhance smartphone security and efficiency by confining and offloading permission-requesting operations. COPE operates by decoupling permission-related tasks from the main application environment, confining them within a secure, isolated execution environment. Furthermore, COPE offloads these operations to a dedicated security module, reducing the main processor's workload and minimizing the attack surface. We implement COPE on the Android platform and evaluate its performance and security through extensive experiments. Our results demonstrate that COPE effectively prevents unauthorized permission access, mitigates the impact of potential vulnerabilities, and improves overall system efficiency by up to 25% compared to traditional permission management systems. COPE provides a robust and scalable solution for modern smartphone security, addressing critical issues in permission handling and resource management.
