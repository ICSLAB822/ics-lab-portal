The evolution of 6G technology towards integrated computing and fusion, with its ultra-low latency and high reliability, is a critical enabler for seamless Metaverse rendering in future vehicular networks. However, vehicular Metaverse rendering faces critical issues of untrustworthy and unbalanced resource distribution. To promote the quality of service (QoS) in vehicular Metaverse, this article proposes a cooperative vehicular Metaverse rendering mechanism by integrating 6G and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve low-latency, high-fidelity, and trustworthy in-vehicle rendering. We first introduce the framework of vehicular edge-enabled Metaverse rendering through the collaboration of roadside unit (RSU) and in-vehicle rendering. Then, the cooperative AI agent scheduling strategy is proposed to improve the resource utilization. An adaptive privacy preservation scheme is developed to protect the privacy information of vehicle users. Next, a case study by considering three scenarios for edge-enabled vehicular Metaverse is exploited. Performance evaluations are conducted to validate the advantages compared to baseline schemes.
