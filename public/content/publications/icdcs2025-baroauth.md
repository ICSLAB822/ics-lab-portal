The growing adoption of smart wearable devices (e.g., earbuds and smart watches) poses new challenges for
secure and seamless user authentication due to their limited interaction interfaces. Conventional biometric methods, including
fingerprints, voice, and facial recognition, often suffer from usability constraints, noise interference, or susceptibility to
spoofing attacks. In this paper, we propose BaroAuth, a novel authentication system that utilizes the stable and distinctive
patterns of Speech-aware Pressure Sequences (SPSs) captured by miniature MEMS barometers embedded in earbuds. The design
of BaroAuth is based on two key observations. First, speech production involves coordinated movements of articulatory organs, such as the jaw, tongue, and soft palate, which reshape the ear canal geometry via the temporomandibular joint (TMJ),
generating subtle pressure variations that encode the speaker’s unique articulatory dynamics and physiological traits. Second,
SPSs demonstrate strong intra-individual consistency and notable inter-individual variability, which can be effectively captured by barometers. We implement the prototype of BaroAuth and conduct comprehensive experiments on it. Experimental results demonstrate that BaroAuth achieves a mean false-acceptance rate (FAR) and false-rejection rate (FRR) of 1.62% and 1.74%, respectively, even under sophisticated attack scenarios.
