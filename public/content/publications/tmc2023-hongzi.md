Voice interaction, as an emerging human-computer interaction method, has gained great popularity, especially on smart devices. However, due to the open nature of voice signals, voice interaction may cause privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called SeVI, to protect voice interaction from being deliberately or unintentionally eavesdropped. SeVI actively generates jamming noise of superior characteristics, while a user is performing voice interaction with his/her device, so that attackers cannot obtain the voice contents of the user. Meanwhile, the device leverages the prior knowledge of the generated noise to adaptively cancel received noise, even when the device usage environment is changing due to movement, so that the user voice interactions are unaffected. SeVI relies on only normal microphone and speakers and can be implemented as light-weight software. We have implemented SeVI on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone and conducted extensive real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that SeVI can defend both online eavesdropping attacks and offline digital signal processing (DSP) analysis attacks.
