The 6G empowered Internet of vehicles paves the way to autonomous driving era, where the ultra-low latency communication and ultra-reliable connections promote the quality of service (QoS) for vehicle users. However, the high data traffic load and communication resource constraint pose a heavy burden to autonomous driving. This paper proposes a secrecy oriented slicing resource allocation scheme in 6G green vehicular networks. We consider that cellular vehicular user (CUE) and vehicular user equipment (VUE) and eavesdropper coexist in the networks, where VUE can reuse the resource block non-orthogonally with CUE, and the eavesdropper may overhear the data transmission of CUE and VUE. To meet the QoS and green communication requirements, we formulate a joint optimization for energy-efficient resource allocation subject to the data rate and secrecy capacity. Despite the non-convex of the formulated problem, we propose corresponding algorithms to derive the optimal resource allocation strategies. Simulation performance validate the effectiveness of our proposal in comparison with benchmark algorithms.
