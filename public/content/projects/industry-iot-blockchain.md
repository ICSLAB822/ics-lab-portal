In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), data sharing across different stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, suppliers, maintenance providers) is essential but hindered by a lack of trust.

We proposed and implemented a blockchain-based data sharing platform that ensures:
1. **Data Integrity**: All sensory data records are immutably logged on a consortium blockchain.
2. **Access Control**: Fine-grained, attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes control who can decrypt and view specific data streams.
3. **Auditability**: All data access and sharing activities are recorded, providing a clear audit trail for compliance.

The system was successfully deployed in a pilot factory environment, demonstrating a 30% reduction in data reconciliation costs.
