We are proud to announce that ICS LAB has been awarded a competitive General Program grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).

The project, titled "Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Computation for Edge Intelligence," addresses the security bottlenecks in deploying AI on edge devices. As IoT devices become more powerful, shifting computation from the cloud to the edge offers latency and bandwidth benefits. However, it also exposes sensitive user data to new attack vectors.

Over the next four years, our team will:
- Develop hardware-friendly cryptographic primitives for edge devices.
- Design privacy-preserving federated learning protocols optimized for unstable network connections.
- Build a prototype smart home system demonstrating our secure edge intelligence framework.

This grant will support two PhD students and facilitate collaboration with international partners.
